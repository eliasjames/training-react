Change summary: Make hardcoded rows dynamic
Method: Remove repeated calls to renderSquare, replace with nested loops 
Reason: Repeated calls are time consuming to edit and prone to bugs
Behavior: 
- browser will show status ("Next player") and empty board
- console will show error "Each child in iterator..."; next version will fix
